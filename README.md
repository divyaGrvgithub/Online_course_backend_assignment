# Online_course_backend_assignment

`A backend system for an online course platform enables users to browse, enroll in, and manage courses. It includes features like user authentication, course management, enrollment tracking, payment processing, discussion forums, analytics, notifications, and scalability considerations. `

# Objective: Build a backend system for an online course platform that allows users to browse, enroll in, and manage online courses.

# Requirements:

# Database Design:

Design a database schema to store information related to users, courses, lessons, enrollments, and progress tracking. You can use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Identify the necessary tables and their relationships, such as users, courses, lessons, enrollments, and progress. Define the appropriate columns for each table.

# User Management:

Implement a user authentication system to allow users to register, log in, and manage their profile information.
Store user credentials securely, preferably by hashing passwords.
Users should be able to update their profile information.

# Course Management:

Create APIs to manage courses, allowing administrators to add, update, and delete course information.
Store information about courses, such as course title, description, instructor, duration, price, and available lessons.
Users should be able to view the list of available courses and access detailed information about each course.

Implement APIs to manage lessons within each course, allowing administrators to add, update, and delete lesson information.
Store information about lessons, such as lesson title, description, content (e.g., text, videos, files), and associated course.
Users should be able to access lessons within the courses they have enrolled in.

# Enrollment and Progress Tracking:

Implement APIs to handle course enrollment requests.
Users should be able to enroll in courses and track their progress.
Store enrollment information, including the user, course, enrollment date, and completion status.
Track and update user progress within a course, indicating the lessons completed.

# Search and Filtering:

Develop APIs to search for courses based on criteria such as course title, instructor, or category.
Implement filtering options to allow users to narrow down their search results.

# Security and Validation:

Implement input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Implement proper error handling and error messages for various scenarios.

Deploy the backend application on a hosting platform or server of your choice.
Document the API endpoints and their functionalities, including request/response formats and any required authentication.
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the application.
Consider using a web framework like Django, Flask, or Express.js to streamline the development process. You can also use libraries like SQLAlchemy or Mongoose for interacting with the database.

`These are some of the core functionalities and considerations when building a backend system for an online course platform. The specific implementation details may vary depending on your platform's requirements and technologies chosen.`
